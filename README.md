 <h2>User Story</h2>
  
  <br/>
  
  <p>I want to create a quiz on Javascript Fundementals to help me study and to gauge my progress compared to my peers.<br/>
  </p>
  
  <br/>
  
<h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>

  <br/>
  
  <ul>
    <li>A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears</li>
    <li>Questions contain buttons for each answer</li>
    <li>When answer is clicked, the next question appears</li>
    <li>If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock</li>
    <li>The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0</li>
    <li>When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score</li>
  </ul>
  
  <br/>

<h2>Resources</h2>

  <br/>
 
  <p>This week to complete this task I utilised my one-on-one tutoring session to help me debug my code. I used w3schools to conduct further studies into JSON, getItem and setItem.<br/>
 <br/>

 <h2>Notes</h2>
 

  <br/>
  
  <p>In this part of my READ.ME page I include things which helped me to complete the project.</p>
  
  <br/>
  
  <ul>
   <li>I was unable to get a decrease in time function to work but this was fixed when my time variable was declared outside of the count function</li>
   <li>I tested out using a time bar for this project using code found on w3schools. Whilst this is interesting to play around with it is just a bit too advanced for me at this time</li>
